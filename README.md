# deep_learning_computer_vision
This is a series of experiments for the subject deep_learning for computer vision,which closely follows the pattern of my academic subject DLCV
# 1) 
Create Histogram of 
a RGB 8-bit image
a sketch on white background
typed or handwritten document (on white background)

# 2)
Write a program to calculate 2DFFT of following type of images:
A handwritten document 
A completely white image

# 3)
On your own image(I took  Donald trump) perform the following operations. Your results must have the original image and corresponding transformed image (hint: to get an idea about how your images must look like visit the attached link):
<br />Translation,
<br />Euclidean Transformation,
<br />Similar transformation,
<br />Affine transform,
<br />Projective transform,

# 4) 
 Implementing Viola jones pretrained parameters to detect faces in an images</br>
 actual viola jones contains 4 stages</br>
 The Viola-Jones algorithm has 4 main steps, and youâ€™ll learn more about each of them in the sections that follow:</br>

1)Selecting Haar-like features</br>
2)Creating an integral image</br>
3)Running AdaBoost training</br>
4)Creating classifier cascades</br>

# 5)
Apply Convolution neural networks using keras and tensorflow for MNIST data set.

# 6)
Cats and Dogs classification using CNN and applying previous concpets like data augmentation to improve model accuracy
